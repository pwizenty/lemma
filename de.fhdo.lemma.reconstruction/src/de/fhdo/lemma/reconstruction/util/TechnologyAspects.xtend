/**
 * The service aspects a hand-written technology model of this bundle declares.
 *
 * The reconstruction finds the annotations a REST controller is written with,
 * and a technology model declares a service aspect for each of them it knows:
 * GetMapping for an operation, PathVariable for a parameter, and so on. Only a
 * declared aspect can be referred to, and only at the join point it is declared
 * for, so the generator asks here before it emits a reference. An annotation
 * the model does not declare is left out: a reference that does not resolve is
 * worse than a visible gap.
 *
 * The declared properties are read along with it, because the reconstruction
 * reports every element value an annotation states while an aspect declares
 * only some of them as properties. @RequestParam(required = false) is the case
 * in Lakeside Mutual: the model gives the aspect a value and a defaultValue and
 * no required, and assigning a property that does not exist would be an error
 * in the generated model.
 *
 * Reading the model is a scan of its declarations rather than a parse, as in
 * [[TechnologyTypes]]: the Technology DSL is not on the classpath of this
 * bundle, and the declarations are what is needed.
