/**
 * Renders a PlantUML file into an image by running PlantUML.
 *
 * PlantUML is run as a command rather than linked as a library: the jar is some
 * twelve megabytes, third-party jars in this repository are resolved by Maven
 * rather than committed, and a research repository is the wrong place for a
 * binary that large. The cost is that the command has to be installed, which is
 * why its absence is reported as a condition to fix and not as a failure of the
 * model.
